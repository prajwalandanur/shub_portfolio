# Portfolio Landing Page Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Modern Tech Portfolio** - Inspired by dark digital agency aesthetics with bold typography and clean layouts. Think Vercel, Linear, and modern developer portfolios.

## Color System
- **Background**: Deep matte black (#0A0A0A)
- **Accent**: Vivid blue (#007BFF) for CTAs, highlights, and interactive elements
- **Text**: White (#FFFFFF) for headings, light gray (#B3B3B3) for body text
- **Hover States**: Lighter blue (#339CFF) with subtle glow effects

## Typography System
- **Headings**: Poppins Extra-Bold or Inter Bold, white with selective blue accent words
- **Subheadings**: Poppins Medium, white
- **Body Text**: Inter Regular, light gray (#B3B3B3)
- **Highlights/Tags**: Italic or Semi-Bold in accent blue
- **Hierarchy**: Large bold → medium weight → regular → italic accents
